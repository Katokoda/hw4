========== Homework 3 of Continuous Optimization ==========
By Estelle Baup, Samuel BÃ©lisle and Cassandre Renaud.

Here we explain what is important for you to understand and test our project.

We followed the scheme and notations of the given instructions, which are in hw4.pdf. Our answers, proofs and calculations to those questions are in the file with a very serious name: AnswersOfTheDreamTeam.pdf. This report also clarifies our steps in more detail. To run our code, one needs to run main.m through Matlab. With our parameters, the program should run for a few seconds and output a long listing in the console.

Note that our functions use the MATLAB Optimization Toolbox.

We believe that all the needed information is in this report. Feel free to contact one of us with our EPFL mail if necessary.
